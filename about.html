    <title>3-Style Commutators</title>

    <p id="information">
        This website allows you to view and visualize my commutators I use for solving a Rubik's Cube blindfolded. I use 3-style, which is the most advanced method for blindfolded solving. 
        If you would like to know how this method works, please check out <a href="https://youtu.be/9KPqwwKNldc?si=o9h_jBxd-DAvLn6u">this video</a>.
    </p>
    <p>My primary buffer is UFR (C in Speffez). Below is a diagram of the Speffez notation. Since 3-style involves cycling 3 pieces (including the buffer), that's why you choose 2 other pieces to cycle!</p>

    <p>Note: You may not cycle to the same piece because that is impossible in 3-style. Examples of invalid cycles are UFR-UBL-LBU or UFR-FUL-LUF. With that said, you may not cycle to the buffer piece.</p>
    <p>Also, here is a link to my public spreadsheet with my algorithms: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1twj2CfYFve5Ba_D8XOwcbXxWaSVKKwZz1QagW4H0uyM/edit?usp=sharing">Here</a></p>
